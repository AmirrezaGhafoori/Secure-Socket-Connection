# Secure-Socket-Connection
This project is an implementation of a secure socket connection using symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption algorithms. 
.pem files includes the public and private RSA keys for client and server 
.text file stores the time for session termination (after session termination new AES key will be generated and exchanged)
